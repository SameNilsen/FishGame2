Hello, another fishing game. This one was a disaster, not finished, no good mechanics. But the goal of making this game was to have another field of view, and that the fishes would only appear as dark shadows in the water, so that you wouldnt know what fish you got before pulling
it out of the water. I also tried making some mechanics for where the bait would land, by having the player use these bars for power and angle. But it just turned out clunky and ugly and hard to use.
